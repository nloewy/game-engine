### Meetings NOAH
* how to communicate action items made during the meeting

Each meeting, we will have one note taker. The note taker will send a recap of every meeting to the group chat every week. There will be two sub-teams within our larger team: frontend and backend. The front end and backend can each have their own procedures for their individual meetings. However, for the larger group meetings, we will go around in a circle and each share their project.

* policy for a team member to give advance notice of missing a team meeting and work required to make up for it


If someone misses a meeting, they are required to submit in writing what they did since the last meeting in “stand-up” format. This should include what they did, what they need to do, and any “blockers”. This can be read aloud by another team member. Additionally, they should contact the notetaker to receive an update on the team’s status.

* policy for handling disagreements, major decisions, or priorities during the meeting

Disagreements and big decisions will be held by a majority vote. We can prioritize things by going through the backlog and giving each action item their own rating of importance, as well as difficulty. If there is an actual personal disagreement between team members, we encourage to try and let them handle it on their own, and then if it is still an issue we can have a larger team intervention.

### Communications DOGA
* decision-making policy (e.g., by consensus? by majority vote?)
  Decisions should be made by majority vote.
* response policy (e.g., respond within 24 hours)
  Team members should respond within 24 hours.
* policy for keeping everyone up-to-date on major decisions, changes, or updates
  Major decisions, changes, or updates should be communicated through daily texts or texts every other day with summaries of what was done to ensure that everyone is informed. Any urgent updates or help needed should be communicated as soon as possible to the rest of the team so that the issues/changes can be acknowledged and resolved.


### Commitments JORDAN
* what does it mean to work to the "best of your ability"
  To put in the time that you can and be focused for the times that you are working; to research design principles and coding techniques when you are unsure of something; to reach out to the group when you have questions or concerns about delivering work
* how to set internal deadlines
  Reach out to the group via an in-person/zoom meeting or group text; have one person propose a deadline and have the majority of the group agree; set more specific internal deadlines within front-end/back-end groups
* how to provide commitments others on the team can rely on
  Be realistic when committing to do something; provide a plan of implementation so that the team can raise any concerns they might have ahead of time; be honest about time limitations you might have in a given week
* policy for resolving failure to meet commitments
  If behavior is repetitive and unresolved, the team may take action such as writing negative feedback in peer review, citing failure to meet commitments in Team Spring Report, or bringing concerns to professors/TAs


### Helping each other - KONUR
* best ways to and when to ask for help

Communicate in the team group chat, whoever knows the answer best will chime in and offer help
Text team members individually - if you know who would be best/know the most about what you need help on, reach out to that person
Ask the teachers/reach out to the TAs

* responses to team member asking for help

Respond positively, and offer your best advice. If you don’t know, seek help from another teammate, a professor, or a TA

* how to support the team priorities

Plan out your week so you ensure ample amount of time to complete your tasks. Always be communicative through channels such as the group chat, and constantly be tracking design requirements, functionalities, etc. and judge the current state of the project based on that. Make sure the team is aware of their state (behind schedule, on schedule, ahead of schedule).

* how to suggest design changes for specific pieces of code

Talk to either the group as a whole, or individual members working on that piece of code about what you want to change. Make sure you explain why that change makes sense, and your motivation for bringing it up. Be as specific as possible, say “in your ___ method…” or better yet “on line 57 of ___ class…”.


## If someone on our team breaks one or more of these agreements, the team may: ALISHA
* have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement
* report the issue in the Team Sprint Report
* others based on your team discussion
  Talk with them about why they are not following the agreements
  If the issue happens repeatedly the team could raise the concern to the professor
